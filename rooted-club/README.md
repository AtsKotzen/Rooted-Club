#### Overview
In order to promote the development of sustainable and regenerative initiatives, AgroforestDAO, in partnership with organic producers, educational institutions, content producers and land owners, using Web3 tools to build on chain governance of Agroforestry Commons supported by the following pillars:

- NFT's as passports and badges.

## What is AgroforestDAO?
A Hub for innovation in Agroforestry Commons.

#### Summary
We are creating Agroforestry-focused spaces, protocols and incentives to support long term positive-sum interactions for knowledge sharing, training and joint ventures, while building reputation and credentials in a membership ID. 
Thats how we build trustful social relationships to serve as a scaffold for emergent partnerships that will co-own regenerative supply chains.
